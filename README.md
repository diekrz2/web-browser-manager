# Web Browser-Manager

A fork of the Classic Zorin OS Browser Manager with a GTK powered GUI.

The Web Browser Manager is a utility designed to assist you in managing the web browsers installed on your computer. With just a few clicks, you can select from a range of browsers and quickly identify the one that best suits your needs.

# Notes

* This application is specific to Bodhi Linux 7.0 or greater. It may not work correctly or fully in another Ubuntu or Debian based distro.

* The Web Browser-Manager works by adding PPAs for some of the browsers not in the Ubuntu or Bodhi repos. Bodhi linux is not reponsible for the packaging or suitability of any browser installed from third party repos. All browers are installed via deb files, no snap or flatpack installations supported.

* The web browsers offered by this application do not reflect and endorsement by Bodhi Linux of the offered product. Some may reguire minor tweaking to obtain a consistent look with your desktop (Moksha) or GTK theme. The security of whatever web browser you install is your responsibilty. Some web browsers offered are Proprietary and not open soiurce. If this matters to you install only FOSS browsers.

# Notes for translators:
WORK IN PROGRESS. A single .pot file has been created in the po folder. Running the INSTALL script will create the .mo file derived from the .po and will place it in "/usr/share/locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES". It is also possible to translate the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications
